### Agisoft Metashape: Video Photo Cutting and 3D Model Building

(Recommended to save the project after each step)

**1\. Cutting Photos from Video**

â€¢ Go to **File > Import > Video**.
â€¢ Choose a folder to save the extracted images.
â€¢ Trim the video to remove unnecessary parts by setting **Cut In** and **Cut Out**.
â€¢ Set **Frame Step** to Large.

**2\. Align the Photos** (This step also call Tie Points)

â€¢ Go to **Workflow > Add Folder > Single > Add Photos**.
â€¢ Next, go to **Workflow > Align Photos**. (Accuracy: Moderate) Once the processing is complete, click the **Camera Icon** to proceed.

**3.** **Move Region**

\* organize the box on the model area.

**4\. Scale the Model**

â€¢ Add marker point **>** Right click on a specific point and 1 more point.

â€¢ Create scale bar **>** Select 2 point in the reference > Right click on the scale bar > modify- change the distance.

â€¢ Model**\>** Transform Object**\> Update Transform**

**5\. Cleaning**

Manual cleaning â€“ go to manual selection icon and select "free form", then select the point that irrelevant and delete.

**6\. Building the Point Cloud**

â€¢ Go to **Workflow > Build Point Cloud**

Quality: Medium
Click- save project after each step
Click- Calculate point confidence
Depth filtering: Mild

(After this stage you can skip to stage 9 and build DEM- if you donâ€™t need a nice 3D model)

**7\. Building the 3D Model (**The "Build Model" - creating a 3D representation of your object, which includes both **dense cloud generation** and **mesh creation**)

â€¢ Go to **Workflow > Build Model**.

- Source data: Point cloud.
- Face count: Moderate.

After the processing is complete, click the **Triangular Icon** to finalize the model.

**8\. Building the Texture (**the **Build Texture** process is used to **apply photographic textures** to a 3D mesh or model, giving it realistic surface details. Essentially, it wraps your 3D model in high-resolution imagery to make it look more lifelike and visually accurate)

â€¢ Go to **Workflow > Build Texture**.

- - Texture type: Diffuse map
    - Source data: images
    - Mapping mode: Generic
    - Blending mode: mosaic
    - Texture size: 8192

After the processing is complete, click the small arrow next to the **Triangular Icon** and select **TEXTURED**.

**9\. Building the DEM** (Digital Elevation Model**\-** represents the elevation of the terrain. It is created from the **dense point cloud** or **mesh)**

â€¢ Go to **Workflow > Build DEM**.

**10\. Building the Orthomosaic (**is a type of aerial photograph that has been geometrically corrected so that the scale of the image is uniform across the entire image. In simpler terms, itâ€™s a **map-like** image where the distortions from the camera angle or topography have been removed, making it a "true" representation of the earth's surface)

â€¢ Go to **Workflow > Build Orthomosaic**.

- Set **Pixel Size** to **0.0005x 0.0005y**.

**11\. Exporting Results**

- Go to **File > Export > Export Orthomosaic**.
- Choose **JPEG** (with **Tiff: None**).
    â€¢ **Export DEM**:
- Go to **File > Export > Export DEM**.
- Choose **Tiff**.
